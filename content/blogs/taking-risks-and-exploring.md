# Exploring Modern Architecture

Modern architecture is a style that emerged in the early 20th century and continues to influence building design today. Characterized by clean lines, functional spaces, and the use of new materials, modern architecture has reshaped city skylines and the way we live.

## Key Features

- **Minimalism:** Focus on simplicity and the elimination of unnecessary details.
- **Open Floor Plans:** Spaces flow into one another, creating a sense of openness.
- **Use of Glass, Steel, and Concrete:** These materials enable innovative forms and large windows.

## Famous Examples

1. **Villa Savoye** (France)  
   Designed by Le Corbusier, this house exemplifies the "Five Points of Architecture" and the use of pilotis (support columns).

2. **Farnsworth House** (USA)  
   Created by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, this glass-walled home blurs the boundary between indoors and outdoors.
